FFTSpectrum
===========

FFTSpectrum is a small application that uses the FFT to generate a spectrogram of a given sound. It was developed during a hackathon.


Libraries
--------

This program uses [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) 3.3.4 for the FFT.

For window management, sound loading, graphics display and user input the [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) 2.3.2 library is used.

For settings parsing I used my own library: [SettingsParser](https://github.com/Foaly/SettingsParser)
